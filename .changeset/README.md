# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Using Changesets

When you make a change that should be documented in a release:

1. Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository
2. Select the packages that have changed
3. Select the type of change (patch, minor, major)
4. Write a summary of the change

The changeset file will be committed with your PR. When the PR is merged to master, the changesets will be consumed to create a release PR.

## Published Packages

Only these packages are published to npm:
- `@character-foundry/character-foundry` - Main library
- `@character-foundry/cli` - Command-line tool

All other packages are internal workspace packages bundled into the main library.
